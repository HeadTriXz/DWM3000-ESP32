# DWM3000-ESP32
The DWM3000-ESP32 Library is a small Arduino library developed for a university project that involves precise localization of people using the Decawave DWM3000 module and the ESP32 microcontroller. The library allows for easy integration of the DWM3000 module with the ESP32, simplifying the communication protocol and allowing for quick and accurate localization data collection.

Usage
-----
The library provides several functions for configuring and reading data from the DWM3000 module. Examples are included to demonstrate how to use the library for basic localization tasks. For more advanced tasks, consult the DWM3000 and ESP32 documentation.

Contributing
------------
This library was created for a university project and is provided as-is. Contributions and improvements are welcome, but there are no current plans for further development or maintenance.
